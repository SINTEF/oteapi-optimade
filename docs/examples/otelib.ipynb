    "# Use OTEAPI-OPTIMADE with OTElib\n",
    "\n",
    "[OTElib](https://github.com/EMMC-ASBL/otelib) is a Python client library for the OTEAPI system.\n",
    "It has two usable backends:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Python-based.\n",
    "   This uses the [OTEAPI Core](https://github.com/EMMC-ASBL/oteapi-core) library directly to exectue pipelines.\n",
    "   This backend should mainly be used for _development_ purposes.\n",
    "2. HTTP requests-based.\n",
    "   This uses the [OTEAPI Services](https://github.com/EMMC-ASBL/oteapi-services) library to execute pipelines via HTTP requests to a running OTEAPI server.\n",
    "   This backend should be used for _production_ purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use OTEAPI-OPTIMADE with OTElib.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Using OTElib we will do different OPTIMADE queries.\n",
    "First, we will search through [the Materials Project](https://materialsproject.org) database for all structures with the formula `Al2O3`.\n",
    "Then, we will search through the Materials Project database for all structures that include `Al` and `O` in their chemical formula.\n",
    "Finally, we will search through [the Materials Cloud](https://materialscloud.org) [MC3D - Materials Cloud three-dimensional crystals database](https://mc3d.materialscloud.org/) for all structures that include `Al` and `O` in their chemical formula."

    "### Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to have a running OTEAPI server.\n",
