description: The attributes used to represent a structure, e.g. unit cell, atoms, positions.
dimensions:
  nelements: Number of different elements in the structure as an integer.
  dimensionality: Number of spatial dimensions. Must always be 3.
  nsites: An integer specifying the length of the `cartesian_site_positions` property.
  nspace_group_symmetry_operations: Number of space group symmetry operations.
  nspecies: Number of species.
  nstructure_features: Number of structure features.
properties:
  elements:
    type: string
    shape: [nelements]
    description: The chemical symbols of the different elements present in the structure.
  elements_ratios:
    type: float
    shape: [nelements]
    description: Relative proportions of different elements in the structure.
  chemical_formula_descriptive:
    type: string
    description: The chemical formula for a structure as a string in a form chosen by the API implementation.
  chemical_formula_reduced:
    type: string
    description: The reduced chemical formula for a structure as a string with element symbols and integer chemical proportion numbers.
  chemical_formula_hill:
    type: string
    description: The chemical formula for a structure in [Hill form](https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja02046a005) with element symbols followed by integer chemical proportion numbers.
  chemical_formula_anonymous:
    type: string
    description: The anonymous formula is the `chemical_formula_reduced`, but where the elements are instead first ordered by their chemical proportion number, and then, in order left to right, replaced by anonymous symbols A, B, C, ..., Z, Aa, Ba, ..., Za, Ab, Bb, ... and so on.
  dimension_types:
    type: int
    shape: [dimensionality]
    description: "List of three integers. For each of the three directions indicated by the three lattice vectors (see property `lattice_vectors`), this list indicates if the direction is periodic (value `1`) or non-periodic (value `0`). Note: the elements in this list each refer to the direction of the corresponding entry in `lattice_vectors` and *not* the Cartesian x, y, z directions."
  nperiodic_dimensions:
    type: int
    description: An integer specifying the number of periodic dimensions in the structure, equivalent to the number of non-zero entries in `dimension_types`.
  lattice_vectors:
    type: float
    shape: [dimensionality, dimensionality]
    unit: Å
    description: The three lattice vectors in Cartesian coordinates, in ångström (Å).
  space_group_symmetry_operations_xyz:
    type: string
    shape: [nspace_group_symmetry_operations]
    description: List of symmetry operations given as general position x, y and z coordinates in algebraic form.
  space_group_symbol_hall:
    type: string
    description: A Hall space group symbol representing the symmetry of the structure as defined in (Hall, 1981, 1981a).
  space_group_symbol_hermann_mauguin:
    type: string
    description: A human- and machine-readable string containing the short Hermann-Mauguin (H-M) symbol which specifies the space group of the structure in the response.
  space_group_symbol_hermann_mauguin_extended:
    type: string
    description: A human- and machine-readable string containing the extended Hermann-Mauguin (H-M) symbol which specifies the space group of the structure in the response.
  space_group_it_number:
    type: int
    description: Space group number which specifies the space group of the structure as defined in the International Tables for Crystallography Vol. A. (IUCr, 2005).
  cartesian_site_positions:
    type: float
    shape: [nsites, dimensionality]
    description: Cartesian positions of each site in the structure. A site is usually used to describe positions of atoms; what atoms can be encountered at a given site is conveyed by the `species_at_sites` property, and the species themselves are described in the `species` property.
  species:
    type: ref
    $ref: http://onto-ns.com/meta/1.0.1/OPTIMADEStructureSpecies
    shape: [nspecies]
    description: A list describing the species of the sites of this structure. Species can represent pure chemical elements, virtual-crystal atoms representing a statistical occupation of a given site by multiple chemical elements, and/or a location to which there are attached atoms, i.e., atoms whose precise location are unknown beyond that they are attached to that position (frequently used to indicate hydrogen atoms attached to another element, e.g., a carbon with three attached hydrogens might represent a methyl group, -CH3).
  species_at_sites:
    type: string
    shape: [nsites]
    description: Name of the species at each site (where values for sites are specified with the same order of the property `cartesian_site_positions`).
  assemblies:
    type: ref
    $ref: http://onto-ns.com/meta/1.0/OPTIMADEStructureAssembly
    description: A description of groups of sites that are statistically correlated.
  structure_features:
    type: string
    shape: [nstructure_features]
    description: A list of strings that flag which special features are used by the structure.
  immutable_id:
    type: string
    description: The entry's immutable ID (e.g., an UUID). This is important for databases having preferred IDs that point to "the latest version" of a record, but still offer access to older variants. This ID maps to the version-specific record, in case it changes in the future.
  last_modified:
    type: string
    description: Date and time representing when the entry was last modified.
